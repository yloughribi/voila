This example demonstrates how to use [Voilà](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) on Binder.

Original code found on [this repository](https://github.com/binder-examples/voila)

## Configuration

If you would like to use the same configuration as this repository but for another project, check out the following steps:

1. Make sure the repository is publicly available (on GitHub, Gitlab or as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com)
2. Define the dependencies in [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml). `requirements.txt` is also supported. In the dependency file, add `voila`.
3. Edit the README file and change the Binder url to https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YOUR-USERNAME/voila/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks where you replace YOUR-USERNAME by your actual github username (you can find it in the link in the address bar in your own repository).
